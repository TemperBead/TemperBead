- 👋 Hi, I’m @TemperBead
- 👀 I’m working with a highly motivated team who intends to upturn how we organise and incentivise innovation using the Dreamcatcher.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the lessons from the Dutch East India and Adam Smith, the last time we tried to update how we do that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all Apps that run on the Dreamcatcher.
- 📫 How to reach me: eigennovember@gmail.com
